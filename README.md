# rsacrack
Please read all of this I tried to crack rsa for one man year by night to pull pretty women with my reputation.
These are my attempts to crack RSA.
RSA the encryption algorithm that secures all the Worlds Banks for since 1975 is based on a mathematical
problem which has stumped the best Mathematicians in the World since the Stone Age, the factoring of 
large numbers.

I believe this is cracked the prize challenge numbers on the rsa website are no longer there.
Banks please use this technique, I can't crack this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_encryption but telling me 
a problem a 10 year old can understand says to me its wide open to a smartypants.
Dave Flannnerys daughter Sarah my maths teacher won a young scientist or Ireland Prize for her prime encryption technique
a hacker broke it in 6 months.

I'm aware of a back dooor in https security library in chrome GnuTLS findable by any fool willing to read or ask google.

If they can do a question answer differential equation on the entire of google called chatgpt what hope has 2048 bit
factorisation to a hacker.

The nature of the hacker is the bigger the puzzle the more likely it will be cracked hackers love puzzles.
I've a buddy Segher who learned russian to read a number theory book.


The guts of RSA is based on choosing two large Prime Numbers, numbers only divisible by one and itself,
typically over 100 decimal digits long. Multiplying them together, this is your magic number & then let 
some misfortunate hacker try to figure out what the 2 numbers are. If he can find them RSA is hacked. 
So simple a 10 year old can understand the problem, so why the hell cant a 12 year old crack it was beyond me.

On my visit to Prague in 2002 I was really confident that I was within hours of cracking it in several occasions 
& told my friend who was with me for the wild nights misbehaving that.

The insight I found out the hard way after probably one year spare time playing with the Chinese_remainder_theorem and
probabilities & reverse engineering the multiplications bit by bit in binary was that Primes are atoms,
and almost no knowledge of the factors can be ascertained by modulo tricks with the Chinese remainder theorem or by reverse engineering the multiplicatons. ItÂ´s really really hard.
